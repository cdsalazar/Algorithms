\indent{\large a) If we have a graph G with four vertices:\{A, B, C, D\}, with weighted edges:\{AB:1, AC:12, BC: 1, CD: 2\}, we will have a unique minimum spanning tree. This graph has the followig two spanning trees from vertex A with edges: $T_1=$\{AB:1, BC:1, CD:2\} and $T_2=$\{AB:1,AC:12,CD:2\}. Even though there are two spanning trees, there is only one, unique MST.}
\\

\indent{\large b) For this problem, we must assume that edge weights do not have to be distinct. If all edge weights are distinct, then Golum would be correct. So, assuming we can have multiple edges with the same weight, the following undirected graph $G$ has two MSTs: \\vertices:\{A, B, C, D, E, F\}\\edges:\{AE:2, AB:4, BC:4, BD:4, DC:4, CF:2\} \\We can see that no edge is unique, and there is still two minimum spanning trees, therefore Golum's claim is incorrect.}
\\

\indent{\large c) For this claim, we must assume that edge weights do not have to be distinct. To prove the claim by contradiction we say that graph $G$ has two minimum spanning trees, $T_{MST}$ and $T'_{MST}$. Let edge $(u,v)$ be in the minimum spanning tree $T_{MST}$, but not $T'_{MST}$. If we were to remove the edge from $T_{MST}$, we will cut the tree into two partitions, $T_u$ and $T_v$. Next, let the edge $(a,b)$ be the unique minimum edge crossing the partition. Given $(x,y) \neq (u,v)$ and we know the weight of $(a,b)$$<$ the weight of $(u,v)$, therefore the spanning tree $(T_{MST}-(u,v))\cup(a,b)$ has a less weight than $T_{MST}$, which is a contradiction. Now, since the edge $(u,v)$ is not in $T'_{MST}$, we say that the path between $u$ and $v$ is path $l$.  Because path $l$ exists, we know that there is some edge, $e$, between $T'_u$ and $T'_v$ (A partition of $T'_{MST}$ where $u$ is in $T'_u$ and $v$ is  in$T'_v$). Now, we also know that $W(u,v)<W(e)$ because as stated above, $(u,v)$ is an unique minimum weighted edge. If we add $(u,v)$ to $T'_{MST}$ we get a cycle composed of the edge $(u,v)$ and the path $l$. By removing any edge from the cycle we get the
spanning tree $(T′_{MST} \cup (u,v)) − e$ which has a lower weight than $T′_{MST}$, this is also a contradiction. Therefore we know that given our claim, there can only be one, unique minimum spanning tree.}
\\

\indent{\large d) To do this, we will modify Kruskal's algorithm which takes $O(E*lg(V))$. We can take Kruskal's, and add some checks in the algorithm like so: 
\begin{verbatim}
uniqueMST(G){ 
  int x[] = sortEdges(G) //array of sorted edges
  tree MST = initialize tree
  boolean uniqueCycle = false
  boolean uniqueMinPart = false
  for(i=1; i < x.length; i++){
    if(createsCycle(MST, x[i])){
      if(isMaxUniqueEdge(x[i]))
        uniqueCycle = true
    }
    else{
      addToTree(x[i])
      if(isMinEdgeConnectingPartitions(MST, x[i]))
        uniqueMinPart = true
    }
  }
  if(uniqueCycle && uniqueMinPart)
    return true
  else
    return false
}
\end{verbatim}
This algorithm performs Kruskal's algorithm, while checking to see if our claim from above is satisfied, thus returning true if there is only one, unique MST.
}

\indent{\large a) To find an arbitrage opprotunity, we will need to set up a graph $G$ with vertices representing currencies, and edges representing exchange rates. We must then find a cycle that when multiplying all the edges, the product is greater than $1$. We also know that taking the $log$ of a number, we can add them up and use that to find an increasing cycle. Finally, we can make the $log$ of the number negative to try and find a negative cycle, which is what Bellman-Ford's algorithm does. So, by adding up the $-log$ of all the edges in a cycle and seeing if the sum is negative, we can find an arbitrage opprotunity. Also, we can multiply each exchange rate by $1.01,$ for $\alpha=.01$ to account for transaction costs. The algorithm will have the general form:
\begin{verbatim}
arbitrageOp(G, alpha){ 
  Graph allOPs[] = new list of Graphs //put Cycles with neg weight in here
  for(all edges (e) in G){
    e = -log(e)*alpha                //apply changes to every edge
  }
  for(int i = 1;i < vertices.length;i++){ //loop through all vertices
    Graph x = bellmanFord(G, i) //run Bellman-Ford on G with start node i, return cycle
    int sum = findSum(x)    //find sum of weights in cycle x      
    if(sum < 0)
      allOps.add(x) //add the cycle to the list if negative weighted
  }
  return allOps
}
\end{verbatim}
This algorithm has a running time of $O(n^3)$. 
}
\indent{\large b) The algorithm implemented above will give us a list of all possible arbitrage opprotunities starting from one currency, and looping around to create a cycle, and ending up at the same currency. The transaction costs, $\alpha$, play a round into whether or not a cycle is negative weighted. By multiplying each edge by $1.01$, for $\alpha=.01$ will take into account the transaction costs. The higher $\alpha$, the less the negative weight of the cycle without transaction costs has to be. So, the greater $\alpha$ gets, the smaller the list of arbitrage opprotunities will become, because the cutoff of how negative the cycle has to be becomes even less(i.e. more negative). }
