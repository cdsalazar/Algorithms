\noindent{\Large \bf Problem 1}
\\
\indent{\large a)  We are assuming the edges on our constructed Huffman binary tree are interpreted as 0 for left, and 1 for right. We also construct the tree from the bottom up, with letters of higher frequency to the right. With these rules in mind our codes for each letter are as follows: }
\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l | l | l | l |}
\hline

$a:0000000$ & $b:0000001$ & $c:000001$ & $d:00001$ &  $e:0001$ & $f:001$ & $g:01$ & $h:1$ 
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\\  

\indent{\large b){ In the first three elements of the list, we have $a:1, b:1, c:2$. This means that adding the $a:1$ and $b:1$ we will get $ab:2$ which is equal to $c:2$. Because these are equal, we can switch them around and still get the same amount of compression. There are $2^2=4$ combinations of Optimal Huffman Codes depending on how we tie-break. Then we can do the same procedure, but mirror the tree. This gives us $1$ more set of optimal codes, then we can do the same permutation on $a:1, b:1,$ and $c:2$ on the mirrored tree to get $4$ more sets of optimal code, and including our own set of codes, we get $10$ total sets of the optimal codes.}
